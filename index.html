          Hello! I’m Courtney-Grace, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a concentration in bioinformatics. I am passionate about empowering others through technology and education. I run <b>The STEMinist Blog</b>, a platform for young girls and women in STEM, promoting cross-cultural exchanges and empowering young girls in STEM. With contributions from female-identifying Ph.D., medical, and undergraduate students in STEM, The STEMinist Blog offers science posts, career advice, and vlogs to support the next generation of women in science and technology.

          <u>I work under Dr. Elaine Luo and Dr. Wenyu Gao at UNC Charlotte</u> in the bioinformatics and statistics department, examining the presence and absence of proteins and linking them to ecosystem functions, particularly carbon cycling. My project uses machine learning techniques, such as LASSO regression and Random Forest, to analyze microbial genomes, employing statistical methods to identify key factors affecting carbon activities. Linking proteins to ecosystem functions like carbon cycling is significant because it provides insight into how microbial processes contribute to global carbon balance, which has implications for understanding and mitigating climate change. You can read more about my research <a href="https://sites.google.com/uncc.edu/microbial-ecology-lab/people?authuser=0">here</a>.

          I just finished my role as an undergraduate teaching assistant for ITSC1600 for five months, where I led first-year students in navigating their transition into the computing field with coursework, conducting discussions, and managing classroom activities to keep students engaged in their learning process. I provided one-on-one office hours and was the primary point of contact for 25 students.

          I have been doing undergraduate research since my sophomore year of college and have recently published my first scientific paper. The paper, titled <i>"Species Biodiversity Utilizing eDNA Analysis in Mill Branch Creek"</i>, is published in <b>EUREKA!: The Journal of Undergraduate Research</b>. I also participated in the <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/ppmh/resources/resources-for-students/edge-genomics/"><u>UNC Chapel Hill EDGE Genomics</u></a> 2-year summer program from 2022 - 2023. Under Dr. Douglas Phanstiel’s mentorship, I mapped RNA-seq data to the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) genome assembly using Bash scripting and R programming. This research aimed to assess the impact of a gapless genome on biological data interpretation. I reprocessed RNA sequencing data from blood cells and visualized the findings, revealing insights into gene activity and disease mechanisms. Following this, I peer mentored undergraduate students in this same program, discussed career paths, and assisted with LinkedIn usage, helping students build confidence and networking skills.

          I am also a recent recipient of the <a href="https://www.blackingenetics.com/"><u>Black in Genetics Fellowship</u></a> Award (Fall 2024, $5000). Awarded annually to one undergraduate and one graduate student, this fellowship recognizes outstanding contributions and potential in genetics. I am currently applying to PhD programs and aim to begin my studies in the Fall of 2025.
